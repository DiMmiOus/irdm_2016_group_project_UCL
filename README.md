Report Title: Collaborative Filtering and Recommendation

Dataset: 100k Movielens dataset
Prediction: We would like to predict the movie ratings of each user using Deep Belief Network based on collaborative filtering.

Report:
1. Introduce the background and motivation of using deep learning for collaborative filering.
2. Describe the methodolgy of the Restrcted Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Network model. In particular, the model setup and the algotithms that we implement.
3. The task, idea and approach of our model.
4. Experiments and Evaluations results.
